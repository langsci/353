\BackTitle{Germanic syntax}
\BackBody{This book is an introduction to the syntactic structures that can be found in the Germanic
  languages. The analyses are couched in the framework of HPSG light, which is a simplified version
  of HPSG that uses trees to depict analyses rather than complicated attribute value matrices.

  The book is written for students with basic knowledge about case, constituent tests, and simple phrase
  structure grammars (advanced BA or MA level) and for researchers with an interest in the Germanic languages and/or an
  interest in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar/Sign-Based Construction Grammar without having the time to deal with all the details of these theories.
