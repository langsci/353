\section*{Foreword of the second edition}


% Gereon Haider is not OV -> VO but rather OVO -> VOO

The first edition of the book claimed that Hubert Haider derives the English clause structure from a
SOV base configuration, but as Gereon Müller pointed out to me, this is not the case. The English
SVOO order is derived from SOVO by movement of the verb.

I added the discussion of (\ref{ex-at-der-ikke-læser-han-en-bog}) on
p.\,\pageref{ex-at-der-ikke-læser-han-en-bog}.

The concept of lexical rules is explained in more detail.

I thank Elisabeth Eberle, who used the book in the tutorial of our Germanic syntax lecture, for comments and questions regarding the first edition of this book.
